# Detecting-Fraudulent-Transactions

This case study addresses an instantiation of the general problem of detecting unusual observations of a phenomena, that is, finding rare and quite different observations. The driving application has to do with transactions of a set of products that are reported by the salespeople of some company. The goal is to find “strange” transaction reports that may indicate fraud attempts by some of the salespeople. The outcome of the data mining process will support posterior inspection activities by the company. These rankings should allow the company to apply its inspection resources in an optimal way.This project addresses several new data mining tasks, namely:

* outlier or anomaly detection, 
* clustering, and also 
* semi-supervised prediction models.
